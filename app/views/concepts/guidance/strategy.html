<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Process</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">A high-level version of the process has been mapped out below for each of the departments
involved in CICA Online BETA testing:</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">IT</h3>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>New Online Application for victims of Sexual assault or abuse goes down – this can
be identified by system monitoring or by a phone call from an external user into the
Customer Service Centre</li>
  <li>E-mail CSC Owner, Business Transformation and copy in Head of Operations to
advise that the New Online Application Service for victims of Sexual assault or abuse
is down and follow up with face to face verbal update</li>
  <li>Upload maintenance page</li>
  <li>Investigate cause for downtime</li>
  <li>Update CSC Owner/Business Transformation of likely down time duration – be as
clear as possible around the number of hours/days it could take</li>
  <li>Identify a solution – if necessary working with 3 rd party provider</li>
  <li>Test and apply solution</li>
  <li>Remove maintenance page</li>
  <li>Notify CSC Owner/Business Transformation that system is working and provide
reasons for the down time</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Customer Service Centre</h3>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>User advises there is an issue with the new Online Application Service for victims of
Sexual assault or abuse</li>
  <li>AD team attempt to resolve the issue over the phone. The advisor needs to identify if
it is the new Online Application Service for victims of Sexual assault or abuse that is
down or if it is user access issues, for example the wrong URL</li>
  <li>If it cannot be resolved over the phone; the issue, user’s contact details and brief
description of the issue, should be recorded on the Private Beta issues log</li>
  <li>Inform Service Desk that the new Online Application Service for victims of Sexual
assault or abuse is down. This can be done by the Assisted Digital Lead verbally and
followed up with an IT ticket</li>
  <li>Inform Business Transformation and the CSC Owner that it is down</li>
  <li>CSC Owner to consider amending IVR to reflect down time issue. This is dependent
on the length of time IT believe the system will be down, a quick fix (a couple of
hours) will likely not need an IVR change</li>
  <li>Use scripts to manage the user’s expectations regarding down time</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Business Transformation</h3>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>Receive communication from IT/CSC AD team</li>
  <li>Send communication to all stakeholders who are supporting Private beta that service
is down</li>
  <li>Provide estimated timescale for down time</li>
  <li>Offer alternative process – existing Justice Portal</li>
  <li>Notify stakeholders when system is working again</li>
