<h1 class="govuk-heading-l"><span class="govuk-caption-xl">CSC guidance for Private Beta</span>
New online form for non-complex sexual assault applications</h1>

<p class="govuk-body">This guidance is for CSC advisors dealing with customer calls generated by the new application form. </p>
<p class="govuk-body">We will update the guidance:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>when new issues are identified</li>
  <li>when we improve and refine the design</li>
  <li>after each new iteration</li>
  </ul>


<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Private Beta</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">Private Beta is the phase when we build a working version of our new online application form. It allows us to test the first iteration with real users. </p>
<p class="govuk-body">The test group will be small and controlled, so that we can closely monitor the performance of the new online application form and gather user feedback. This will help us understand how it’s working and what improvements we can make. </p>
<p class="govuk-body">Through user testing, gathering feedback and data, and by using it to iterate the design, we will have the confidence to extend it to a wider audience and eventually open it up to all users. </p>
<p class="govuk-body">We will invite users into Private Beta in one of 2 ways:
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>Our 3rd party support providers (for example Victim Support, Rape Crisis etc) will provide them with the link to our new service</li>
  <li>CSC advisors will identify suitable users during calls and provide them with the link or complete the application on their behalf.</li>
</ul></p>


<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">First iteration</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">The first iteration will serve users who:
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>have an email address</li>
    <li>are victims of sexual assault or abuse</li>
    <li>select to have their application decided on police evidence only (OCJ)</li>
    <li>are 18 or over</li>
    <li>are a British citizen or EU national</li>
    <li>do not have a representative</li>
  </ul>
  </p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Key changes</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">Some of the keys changes from the existing online application form are:
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>the user will no longer access the Justice Portal</li>
    <li>they will not create an account</li>
    <li>they will not be able to save and return to the application later</li>
    <li>the application summary will not be issued automatically for telephone applications</li>
    <li>a reduction in questions – shortest journey reduced from 41 to 18, longest journey reduced from 64 to 27.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
