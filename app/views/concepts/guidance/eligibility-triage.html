Eligibility check and triage</h1>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Questions to establish initial eligibility: CSC advisor</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">Ask the usual eligibility questions:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>what is the incident you want to claim for? (is it a crime of violence?)</li>
  <li>when did the incident happen? (was it within the last 2 years?)</li>
  <li>where did the incident happen? (was it in Great Britain?)</li>
  <li>did you report it to the Police? If so, when? (was there any delay in reporting?)</li>
  <li>what were your injuries? (do the injuries qualify as per the Scheme?)</li>
  <li>do you have any unspent criminal convictions? (would these stop them from qualifying?)</li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body">If they are eligible go on to First Triage for Private Beta.</p>
