    <section>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Questions to establish initial eligibility: CSC advisor</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">The usual eligibility questions should be asked:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>what is the incident you want to claim for? (is it a crime of violence?)</li>
        <li>when did the incident happen? (was it within the last 2 years? Was it prior to 01/10/1979?)</li>
        <li>If the incident or period of abuse took place or started before 01/10/1979, were you and the assailant living together as part of the same family when the incident took place? (Is this a same roof rule case?)*</li>
        <li>where did the incident happen? (was it in Great Britain?)</li>
        <li>did you report it to the Police? If so, when? (was there any delay in reporting?)</li>
        <li>what were your injuries? (do the injuries qualify as per the Scheme? May not be necessary if sexual offences involved.)</li>
        <li>do you have any unspent criminal convictions? (would these stop them from qualifying?)</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body">If there are any eligibility issues arising from these questions, continue with business as usual and</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li> inform the applicant that they may not be eligible</li>
        <li> tell them that they still have the right to apply</li>
        <li> manage their expectations about eligibility</li>
        <li> direct them to the current OAS on the Justice portal or take a telephone application</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body">*If you identify a potential same roof rule case, follow the process set out in the SRR Call Aids sheets. You should then ask the following:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>Could I take your name?</li>
        <li>Could I also take your telephone number?</li>
        <li>Would you prefer to speak to a male colleague or a female colleague?</li>
        <li>If it is not possible to transfer to an appropriate colleague at this time, when would be the best time for them to call you?</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">If they are eligible and do not fall within the SRR process, go on to the First Triage for private beta.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">First triage for private beta: CSC advisor</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">Check if the user meets the criteria for private beta. You may have already established the answers to some of these questions during the eligibility check:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>are you claiming as a victim of sexual assault or abuse?</li>
        <li>do you have an email address?</li>
        <li>are you a British citizen or EU national?</li>
        <li>are you 18 or over?</li>
        <li>are you applying for yourself or someone else?</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body">If the user answers ‘no’ at any point in the triage you do not need to ask further triage questions. Continue as usual by highlighting the benefits of current OAS:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>it can be less traumatic</li>
        <li>you can take as long as you want. No need to go through it all in one long phone call</li>
        <li>if you don’t have all the information you can save as a draft and come back to it, take a break halfway through</li>
        <li>you’ll get an email confirmation</li>
        <li>you can describe things in your own words, not the words of an advisor</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body">You should then direct the user to the current online application or take a telephone application.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">If the user answers ‘yes’ to all the First Triage questions, move on to Second Triage for private beta.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Second triage for private beta: CSC advisor</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">The second triage will identify those who want to use our new application without support. You should:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>explain that we have a new online application service they can use</li>
        <li>explain the benefits, for example it is simple and easy to use, has fewer questions, you can do it in your own time</li>
        <li>ask the user if they want to go online and do it themselves</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body">If 'yes’ then:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>note the user’s name and email address on the CSC private beta URL tracker</li>
        <li>send them an email with the URL link to private beta</li>
        <li>tell them they will be asked some simple triage questions first to make sure they can use it and if not, will be redirected to the existing service to complete the application</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body">If ‘no’, and they want to do it over the phone, check that they have:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>approximate date of crime</li>
        <li>name of police force dealing with it</li>
        <li>crime reference number</li>
        <li>location where crime happened</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body">If they have these then:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>advise them you will transfer them to an advisor who is trained to take the new application</li>
        <li>transfer the call to one of the advisors on the assisted digital team:
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>Richard McGovern</li>
            <li>Joseph Smith</li>
            <li>Gregor Preston-Jones</li>
            <li>Ross Little</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>


      <p class="govuk-body">If they do not have these then tell the user:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>to call back when they do</li>
        <li>to select option 8 when they call</li>
        <li>that they will be put straight through to an advisor who can take the new application</li>
      </ul>

    </section>

    <section>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Taking the new application: Assisted Digital team</h2>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>use the private beta URL to take a telephone application</li>
        <li>use the guidance to help support the user</li>
        <li>note the user’s details, any issues or difficulties on the PB application tracker</li>
        <li>include the case reference number once the application has been submitted</li>
