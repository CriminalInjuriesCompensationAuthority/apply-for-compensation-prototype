          Disabling mental injuries
        </h2>
        <p class="govuk-body-m">A disabling mental injury has a substantial adverse effect on your ability to carry out normal day to day activities.  It does not include temporary mental anxiety, but may include:</p>

             <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
               <li>impaired performance at work or school</li>
               <li>negative effects on social relationships</li>
               <li>negative impacts on your sex life and intimacy</li>
             </ul>

             <p class="govuk-body-m">Your disabling mental injury symptoms must have lasted for 6 weeks or more for us to consider paying compensation.  We may also ask you to have your mental injuries assessed by a clinical psychologist.</p>

          <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Compensation for other losses</h2>
          <p></p>
          <p class="govuk-body">We can also consider applications for compensation for:</p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
              <li>physical injuries</li>
              <li>loss of earnings</li>
              <li>other expenses for example, special equipment, providing care</li>
              <li>other consequences of the crime for example, pregnancy, loss of foetus and sexually transmitted disease</li>
            </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">Cases involving disabling mental and physical injuries and other losses are usually more complex and take more time for us to make a deicsion.</p>
