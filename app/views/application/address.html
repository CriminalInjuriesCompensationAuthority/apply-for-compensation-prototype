        <p class="design-notes">Content on this page needs to be seen by John and approved - Design is only the first draft: you would either have a UK address and know the postcode and can enter it, or you don't have it and we help the user finding it. - to be tested though as they might prefer to enter manually without the postcode? - SK</p>

        <p class="design-notes">We are faking it just now and there is no validation so <strong> entering anything for the post code will do</strong> -SK</p>
