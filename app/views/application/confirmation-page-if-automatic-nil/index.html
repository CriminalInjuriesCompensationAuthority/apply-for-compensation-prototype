        <p>Dear Mr Smith</p>

        <p>You stated in your application for criminal injuries compensation that you:
          <ul>
            <li class="govuk-body">did not report the crime to the police</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Your application has been rejected for the following reasons:</p>
        <ul>
          <li class="govuk-body">the crime must be reported to the police (paragraph 22 of the 2012 Scheme)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you do not agree with this decision you can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/criminal-injuries-compensation-a-guide#decisions-and-administering-payments" target="_blank">request a review.</a>
        </p>
