<div>
    <p>You might be able to claim compensation if you were the victim of a violent crime. This includes if:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>you were injured</li>
        <li>a close relative died</li>
        <li>you saw the crime happen to a loved one (or were there immediately afterwards)</li>
        <li>you paid for the funeral of a person who died</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You usually have to claim within 2 years of the crime. The crime must be reported to the police before you apply.</p>

    <div class="govuk-inset-text">
    <p>The process is different if the crime happened in <a rel="external" href="https://www.justice-ni.gov.uk/topics/justice-and-law/compensation-services#toc-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Northern Ireland</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <p>It does not cost anything to apply.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">If you were injured trying to stop a crime</h2>

    <p>You might also be able to claim compensation if you were taking a ‘justified and exceptional’ risk trying to stop a crime. For example somebody was in danger and it was not a situation that you were trained to deal with.</p>
