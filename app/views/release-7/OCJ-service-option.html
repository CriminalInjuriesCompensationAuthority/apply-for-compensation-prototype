                  <li>abbreviations like CICA should never be used unless they are widly used and you can prove that users understand them</li>

                  <li>why do we need to tell users that we will check their eligibility, don't they expect this of an application service?</li>
                  <li>why do we need to tell users how long it will take at this point it would be better at the beginning or end of the application </li>
                  <li>at this point it's a bit late to tell users if they cant use the application service</li>
                  <li>We need to understand what users need from this content not what we want to tell users</li>
