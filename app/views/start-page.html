          Apply for criminal injuries compensation
        </h1>

        <p class="govuk-body-l">Use this service to apply for compensation if, because of a violent crime, physical or sexual assault or abuse:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>you suffered physical injuries</li>
            <li>you suffered mental injuries</li>
            <li>a close relative died</li>
            <li>you saw the crime happen to a loved one (or were there immediately afterwards)</li>
            <li>you paid for the funeral of a person who died</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-s">
          Eligibility
        </h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">Usually you must apply within 2 years of the crime happening.  We may make an exception if:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>you were a victim of childhood abuse</li>
          <li>you were advised to wait until a criminal case had ended</li>
          <li>you can show that you could not apply earlier, for example your mental or physical health stopped you</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">The crime must be reported to the police.  If it is not reported, we cannot pay compensation.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">The crime must have happened in England, Wales or Scotland. There is a different service for <a href="https://www.justice-ni.gov.uk/topics/justice-and-law/compensation-services" target="_blank">Northern Ireland.</a></p>
        <p class="govuk-body">We can pay compensation even if the court finds the offender not guilty.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">Compensation is paid by the UK government, not by the offender.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-s">
          What you'll need
        </h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">To complete your application, you'll need:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>an email address we can use to contact you</li>
          <li>the date the crime happened</li>
          <li>the crime reference number the police gave you when you reported the crime</li>
        </uL>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Before you start</h2>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-s">Help with your application</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">Some of the organisations that can give you free help or support include:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li><a href="https://rapecrisis.org.uk/" target="_blank">Rape crisis</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.victimsupport.org.uk/" target="_blank">Victim Support</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/" target="_blank">Citizens Advice</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.victimsinformationservice.org.uk/" target="_blank">Victims Information Service</a></li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">You do not need to use a legal representative to help you with your application. Legal representatives typically charge between 20% to 30% of any compensation you may get.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-s">Legal representatives</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">If you are a legal representative applying for compensation on behalf of a client, you should use the <a href="https://beta.cica.gov.uk/">Apply for compensation as a legal representative</a> service.</p>
