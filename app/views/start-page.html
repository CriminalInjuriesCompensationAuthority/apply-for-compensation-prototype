          Apply for criminal injuries compensation
        </h1>

        <p class="govuk-body-l">Use this service to apply for compensation if as a result of a violent crime:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>you were injured</li>
            <li>a close relative died</li>
            <li>a loved one was injured and you witnessed it</li>
            <li>you paid for the funeral of a person who died</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">Usually you must apply within 2 years of the crime happening.  We may make an exception if:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>you were a victim of childhood abuse</li>
          <li>you can show that you could not apply earlier, for example your mental or physical health stopped you</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">The crime must be reported to the police.  If it is not reported we cannot pay compensation.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">The crime must have happened in England, Wales or Scotland. There is a different service for <a href="https://www.justice-ni.gov.uk/topics/justice-and-law/compensation-services" target="_blank">Northern Ireland.</a></p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Before you start</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">To complete your application you'll need to know the:</p>

          <li>crime reference number the police gave you when you reported the crime</li>
        </uL>

        <p class="govuk-body">You do not need to use a legal representative to help you with your application unless you want to. If you do use a representative, they may charge you a percentage of any money you get.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-s">Legal representatives</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">If you are a legal representative applying for compensation on behalf of a client you should use the <a href="https://beta.cica.gov.uk/">Apply for compensation as a legal representative</a> service.</p>
