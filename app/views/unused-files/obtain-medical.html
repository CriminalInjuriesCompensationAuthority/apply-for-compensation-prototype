            <p class="design-notes">@John, I've reordered this content moving the hint above the question as I think users would need to know about the payment before they can answer the question.</p>
            <p class="design-notes">We shouldn't be using CICA. Either use Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (not ideal as that's just another government department that users have to know about) or use the word "we".</p>
