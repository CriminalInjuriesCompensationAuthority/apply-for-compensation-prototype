        <p>After user research on the 11/12 September 2018 and discussons with the MOJ content community we changed the word survivor to victim just before the end fo the sprint.</p>

        <p>Not many changes to the prototype in this sprint as we were focussing on looking at Google Analytics to inform the design.</p>
        <p>Changes that were made were:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>content changes to the rep question</li>
          <li>moved the declaration to the beginning of the application</li>
          <li>content changes to the screen that is displayed if the crime was not reported to the police</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-l"><a href="https://cica-app-r8.herokuapp.com/start-page">Release 8</a><span class="govuk-caption-m">MVP Sprint 3</span></h3>
        <p>Following user research we are iterating the design of the MVP service.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-bottom-9"><strong class="govuk-tag warning-tag">NEW FLOW</strong></p>
        <p>We are not using the stepped guide anymore and the sequence of the screens have been changed</p>

        <p><strong>Address look-up</strong> screen added, based on the <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/addresses/">video displayed here</a>. Three possible situations:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>the user has a UK address and once they submit their postcode they get list of possible addresses for it and select one (this is mocked)</li>
          <li>the user has a UK address but doesn't know the postcode, they can enter it manually</li>
          <li>the user doesn't have a UK address and is taken to a screen when they can enter the address in a single text. <span style="color: #b10e1e"><strong>Warning:</strong> this might cause some IT issues as this format is not supported at the moment</span></li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Delay applying</strong> (over 2 years) is included now. You will be asked for a reason why you delayed applying if it's a:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>single incident and the incident happened more than two years on the day of application</li>
          <li>period of abuse and using the last day of the month of the end of the period of abuse, then it's more than 2 years from the day of application </li>
        </ul>
        <em><p class="govuk-caption-m">For example: </p>
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet govuk-caption-m">
            <li>the incident (single incident) was on the 1/01/2016 - if the applicant is applying on the 1/01/2018 it's fine, but if applying on 2/01/2018 or later, then after entering the incident date in the flow, they would see the screen "Why did you delay making your claim?"</li>
            <li>the end of the period of abuse was on January 2016 - if the applicant is applying in January 2018 including on the 31/01/18 it's fine but if applying from the 1st of February then after entering the incident date in the flow, they would see the screen "Why did you delay making your claim?"</li>
          </ul>
        </em>

        <p><strong>Delay reporting</strong> (more than 48h) is included now. You will be asked for a reason why you delayed reporting using the:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>day of the incident if it's a single incident</li>
          <li>last day of the month of the end of the period of abuse otherwise</li>
        </ul>

        <em><p class="govuk-caption-m">For example: </p>
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet govuk-caption-m">
            <li>the incident (single incident) was on the 1/01/2018 - if the applicant reported it on the 3/01/2018 it's fine, but if it was reported on 4/01/2018 or later, then after entering the date they reported the incident on in the flow, they would see the screen "Why was there a delay in reporting the crime to police?"</li>
            <li>the end of the period of abuse was on January 2018 - if the applicant reported it on 02/02/2018 (so still within 48h after the end of the month = 31/01/2018) it's fine but if it was reported on the 3rd of February then after entering the date they reported the incident on in the flow, they would see the screen "Why was there a delay in reporting the crime to police?"</li>
          </ul>
